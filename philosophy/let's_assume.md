# 🕯️ Let's assume...
"Let's assume" is a philosophical and religious project aimed at prooving statements about God through some foundational assumptions and logical reasoning.
## 📎 Assumptions
### (1) Let's assume "god" exists.
By "God" I neither mean the "old white man above the clouds" nor what the biblical texts teach us, but rather an undefined *something* that exists. Even though I won't rely on biblical texts, I will examine the believes of others and analyse them. 
### (2) Let's assume "God" has more properties than just existence.
## 🖇️ Implications
### (a) Anyone who only believes in "God's" existence, without making further assumptions about other properties, believes the truth. (1, 2)
Anyone who believes in specific attributes of "God" could be wrong. Christians believe that people who believe in "God" (and Jesus) can go to heaven. But does somebody really believe in anything if he or she makes wrong assumptions about that something? Could a strong faith be counterproductive, and do people who believe only the bare minimum live the "right" way?
