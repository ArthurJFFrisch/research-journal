# 🕯️ Let's assume...
"Let's assume" is a philosophical and religious project aimed at proving statements about God through some foundational assumptions and logical reasoning.
## 📎 Assumptions
### (1) Let's assume "God" exists.
By "God" I neither mean the "old white man above the clouds" nor what the biblical texts teach us, but rather an undefined *something* that exists. Although I do not rely on biblical texts, I will examine and analyze the beliefs of others.
### (2) Let's assume "God" has more properties than just existence.
## 🖇️ Implications
### (a) "God" has to follow the *laws of logic*
A non-logical "God" would imply, that we could not make any true assertions about properties of "God". We could also not say that "God" exists, because that would be an asumption about one of "Gods" properties. If we take "Gods" existence as an axiom, "God" has to follow the *laws of logic*. I won't define the axioms for the *laws of logic* here, but they can be referenced under **"ZFC"** (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and the axiom of choice).
### (b) Anyone who only believes in "God's" existence, without making further assumptions about other properties, believes the truth. (1, a, 2)
Anyone who believes in specific attributes of "God" could be wrong. Christians believe that people who believe in "God" (and Jesus) can go to heaven. But does somebody really believe in anything if he or she makes wrong assumptions about that something? Could a strong faith be counterproductive, and do people who believe only the bare minimum live the "right" way?
### (c) "God" is not omnipotent. (1, a)
There are numbers, which cannot be calculated (see the "Halting Problem") and since logical reasoning applies to "God", it implies, that "God" cannot do the impossible (such as calculating uncomputable numbers). From the inability to perform an action (even if it is impossible) follows, that "God" is not omnipotent.
