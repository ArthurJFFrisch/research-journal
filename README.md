# 🔭 research-journal | Arthur Frisch
## 🎇 Objective
Welcome to my public research journal. This repository serves as a formal documentation of my independent studies and explorations into the topics that fascinate me.

My name is Arthur John Fritz Frisch, and I am a 12th-grade student with a passion for digging deep into the worlds of Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, and Philosophy. I created this space to document small projects, track my evolving ideas, and share my journey through these interconnected fields of science.
